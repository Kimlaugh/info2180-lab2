            favourite pasta recipe :).

        <h2>TV Series not worth your while</h2>
        <i>September 29, 20222 by Kimberly Laughton</i>
        <img src="riverdale.jpg" alt="Riverdale"id="image3">
        <p id="p2">I loveee television series, but some not so much. Let me break it down for you, my personal ratings and all.<br>
            1. Legacies (The TVD spin-off)<br>
            Rating 5.5/10<br>
            I was looking forward to this new take on vampire diaries and Originals but after the first few episodes it didnt take me too long
            to realize the show was a disaster. I guess it was intended for a younger audience as the show overall lacked maturity nothing like its predecessors
            The supernatural was never a realistic concept but this show managed to make it even more unrealistic and similar to child's fairytale story book. I think
            you should skip this one.<br>
            2. The Shadow Hunters<br>
            Rating 6/10<br>
            Now if you read the books youd be disappointed too. Acting was tolerable but not the greatest. You should just stick to the books trust me.
            3. The Flash
            Rating 6/10
            Now, dont get me wrong I like this show, well the first 3 seasons of it. After the 3rd season or so you kinda just realize that the show
            is greatly repetitive and predictable. He will always be the hero, he will always save the day. Its a good watch if you feel safe in the predictability
            of it. I would also like to mention that most of DC's mini series are like this. PREDICTABLE.<br>

            Rating 5/10
            Do I even have to justify this? I dont think so.
